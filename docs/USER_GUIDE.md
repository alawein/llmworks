## Getting Started

### Welcome to LLM Works

LLM Works is an open-source platform for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)
through interactive testing and rigorous benchmarking. Our platform provides two
main evaluation modes:

- **The Arena**: Interactive, comparative testing between models
- **The Bench**: Standardized benchmark suites (MMLU, TruthfulQA, GSM8K)

### First Steps

1. **Access the Platform**: Navigate to [llmworks.dev](https://llmworks.dev)
2. **Configure Models**: Go to Settings → Models to add your API keys
3. **Choose Evaluation Type**: Select Arena for interactive testing or Bench for
   standardized benchmarks
4. **Review Results**: Check the Dashboard for detailed analytics and insights

### System Requirements

- **Browser**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+,
  Safari 13+, Edge 80+)
- **Internet Connection**: Required for model API calls
- **Local Storage**: ~5MB for preferences and cached data

## The Arena

The Arena provides interactive, head-to-head model comparisons through
structured debates, creative challenges, and explanation tasks.

### Arena Modes

#### 1. Debate Mode

Models argue opposing sides of a topic with a judge model evaluating arguments.

**How to Use:**

1. Select 2+ models for comparison
2. Choose or enter a debate topic
3. Configure debate parameters (rounds, time limits)
4. Select a judge model
5. Start the debate and review real-time results

**Best Topics:**

- Ethical dilemmas: "Should AI be regulated?"
- Scientific questions: "Is nuclear energy sustainable?"
- Philosophical debates: "Does free will exist?"

#### 2. Creative Sandbox

Models collaborate on creative tasks with iterative refinement.

**How to Use:**

1. Select models for Creator and Refiner roles
2. Provide a creative brief (story, poem, business plan)
3. Set refinement rounds
4. Review collaborative outputs
5. Compare final results

**Example Tasks:**

- Write a sci-fi short story
- Create a marketing campaign
- Design a mobile app concept

#### 3. Explanation Challenge

Models explain complex topics, optimized for different audiences.

**How to Use:**

1. Choose models for Expert and Student roles
2. Enter a complex topic
3. Set audience level (elementary, high school, college, expert)
4. Configure explanation parameters
5. Evaluate clarity and accuracy

### Arena Results

## Best Practices

### Choosing Models for Evaluation

#### For Arena Testing:

- **Balanced Comparison**: Choose models with similar capabilities
- **Diverse Strengths**: Test models with different architectural approaches
- **Clear Objectives**: Define what you're testing (creativity, reasoning,
  factual accuracy)

#### For Benchmark Testing:

- **Baseline Models**: Include well-known models for reference
- **Version Consistency**: Use specific model versions for reproducibility
- **Cost Consideration**: Balance evaluation depth with API costs

### Evaluation Design

#### Prompt Engineering:

- **Clear Instructions**: Be specific about task requirements
- **Neutral Phrasing**: Avoid leading or biased language
- **Consistent Format**: Use standardized prompt templates

#### Statistical Validity:

- **Multiple Runs**: Test several times for reliable results
- **Sample Size**: Use sufficient test cases for statistical significance
- **Control Variables**: Keep parameters consistent across models

### Result Interpretation

#### Understanding Scores:

- **Context Matters**: Consider the evaluation context and goals
- **Statistical Significance**: Look for meaningful differences, not just score
  variations
- **Category Analysis**: Examine performance breakdowns by task type

#### Making Decisions:

- **Multi-metric Evaluation**: Don't rely on single scores
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Consider API costs vs. performance gains
- **Use Case Alignment**: Choose models that match your specific requirements

## Troubleshooting
