# Critical Security Fixes Implementation (January 2025)

## Executive Summary

This document details the implementation of critical security fixes addressing
HIGH RISK and CRITICAL vulnerabilities identified in the security review. All
vulnerabilities have been addressed with enterprise-grade security measures.

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Analytics Data Exposure (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED

**Previous Issue**: ANY authenticated user could view ALL analytics data
including:

- Other users' analytics events
- Anonymous user sessions
- Business intelligence data
- URLs, user agents, session information

**Fix Implemented**:

```sql
-- Old vulnerable policy (REMOVED)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view analytics events"
  FOR SELECT USING ((auth.uid() = user_id) OR (user_id IS NULL));

-- New secure policy (IMPLEMENTED)
CREATE POLICY "Users can only view their own analytics events"
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND user_id IS NOT NULL);
```

**Security Controls Added**:

- Users can ONLY see their own events
- Anonymous events completely hidden from regular users
- Admin-only access to full analytics via `is_admin()` function
- Aggregated safe views for public statistics
- thorough audit logging for all analytics access

### 2. OTP Long Expiry (WARNING) ✅ FIXED

**Previous Issue**: OTP tokens had 24-hour expiry (default)

**Fix Implemented** in `supabase/config.toml`:

```toml
[auth]
otp_expiry = 300  # 5 minutes (down from 24 hours)
max_otp_attempts = 3  # Limit brute force attempts

[auth.email]
otp_expiry = 300
max_frequency = 60  # Rate limiting

[auth.sms]
otp_expiry = 300
max_frequency = 60  # Rate limiting
```

**Additional Security**:

- MFA enabled
- JWT expiry: 1 hour
- Refresh token rotation enabled
- Minimum password length: 10 characters
- Password requirements: letters, digits, symbols

### 3. API Key Security Vulnerability (HIGH RISK) ✅ FIXED

**Previous Issue**: Encrypted API keys could be exposed if RLS policies fail

**Fix Implemented**:

- **Web Crypto API** encryption (AES-GCM-256)
- **PBKDF2** key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **No hardcoded encryption keys** - fails in production without proper config
- **Separate security levels**: standard, enhanced, critical
- **Key rotation** capabilities
- **Access logging** for every API key access
- **Audit trail** for all key operations

**New Security Architecture**:

```typescript
// Historical example only. The current client has no encryption-salt consumer.
```

### 4. Missing Email Redirect Configuration ✅ FIXED

**Previous Issue**: Authentication emails had no redirect configuration

**Fix Implemented** in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`:

```typescript
const signUp = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const redirectUrl = `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`;

  return supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: {
      emailRedirectTo: redirectUrl, // Added
    },
  });
};
```

### 5. Admin Role System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**New Features**:

- `user_roles` table with RBAC
- `is_admin()` function for role verification
- Admin-only views and functions
- Role assignment validation
- Audit trail for role changes

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations

- `supabase/migrations/20250813_critical_security_fixes.sql` - Complete security
  overhaul

### Configuration

- `supabase/config.toml` - Enhanced auth security settings
- `.env.example` - Critical security warnings added

### Security Libraries

- `src/lib/secure-api-keys.ts` - Enterprise-grade API key management
- `src/lib/secure-analytics.ts` - Strict analytics access control

### Authentication

- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Added email redirect and password reset

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Multiple security layers for each component
- Fail-secure defaults
- thorough validation at every level

### 2. Zero Trust Analytics

- No implicit trust for authenticated users
- Strict user isolation
- Admin verification for sensitive operations

### 3. Encryption Standards

- AES-GCM-256 for API keys
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Web Crypto API (browser native)
- No hardcoded keys in production

### 4. Audit Trail

- `security_audit_log` table
- All sensitive operations logged
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Severity levels: info, warning, critical

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Do not set a Vite client encryption salt. The
   current app has no provider-key encryption path; future provider work must
   keep encryption and keys on the server.

2. **Database Migration**:

```bash
# Apply security migration
supabase migration up 20250813_critical_security_fixes.sql
```

3. **Initial Admin Setup**:

```sql
-- Set first admin user (one-time only)
SELECT public.set_initial_admin('admin@example.com');
```

4. **Verify Security**:

- [ ] OTP expiry is 5 minutes
- [ ] Analytics access restricted
- [ ] API key encryption working
- [ ] Email redirects configured
- [ ] Admin role system active

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Authentication**:
   - Failed login attempts
   - OTP usage patterns
   - Password reset requests

2. **Analytics Access**:
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Admin analytics usage
   - Export operations

3. **API Keys**:
   - Key rotation frequency
   - Access patterns
   - Failed decryption attempts

### Security Audit Queries

```sql
-- Check for security violations
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE severity = 'critical'
AND created_at > now() - interval '24 hours';

-- Monitor admin access
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE action LIKE 'admin_%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- API key access patterns
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE resource_type = 'models'
AND action = 'api_key_accessed';
```

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Analytics Access**: Regular users can no longer see anonymous events
2. **OTP Validity**: Reduced from 24 hours to 5 minutes
3. **Password Requirements**: Increased to 10 characters with symbols
4. **API Key Encryption**: Requires environment variable in production

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Review `security_audit_log` weekly
2. **Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys every 90 days
3. **Admin Management**: Limit admin roles to essential personnel
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical security events
5. **Updates**: Apply security patches immediately

## 📊 Security Status

| Vulnerability      | Previous Risk | Current Status | Verification         |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Analytics Exposure | CRITICAL      | ✅ FIXED       | RLS policies updated |
| OTP Expiry         | WARNING       | ✅ FIXED       | 5-minute expiry      |
| API Key Security   | HIGH          | ✅ FIXED       | Web Crypto API       |
| Email Redirect     | WARNING       | ✅ FIXED       | Redirect configured  |
| Encryption Salt    | HIGH          | ✅ FIXED       | No hardcoded values  |
| Admin System       | MISSING       | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | RBAC active          |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy** security migration to production
2. **Keep provider keys out of browser configuration**
3. **Assign** initial admin user
4. **Monitor** security audit logs
5. **Test** all authentication flows
6. **Verify** analytics access restrictions
