### Redirect Mapping

```
Old Pattern              New Pattern              Status
aegis-ai.com/*          llmworks.dev/*           301
app.aegis-ai.com/*      llmworks.dev/*           301
/aegis/*                /arena/*                 301
/aegis-ai/*             /*                       301
/platform/*             /*                       301
/docs/aegis/*           /docs/*                  301
```

## SEO Migration Plan

### 1. Google Search Console

```bash
# Add new property
1. Add llmworks.dev as new property
2. Verify ownership via DNS TXT record
3. Submit new sitemap.xml
4. Set preferred domain to llmworks.dev
```

### 2. Sitemap Updates

- Update all URLs in sitemap.xml
- Include canonical URLs pointing to new domain
- Monitor crawl errors in Search Console

### 3. Backlink Preservation

- Keep 301 redirects permanent (minimum 1 year)
- Reach out to major referring sites for updates
- Monitor referring domain reports

## Analytics Migration

### Google Analytics 4

```javascript
// Update tracking code
gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
  'custom_map.page_location': 'llmworks.dev',
});

// Set up cross-domain tracking if needed
gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
  linker: {
    domains: ['llmworks.dev', 'aegis-ai.com'],
  },
});
```

### Custom Events

```javascript
// Track migration-related events
gtag('event', 'domain_migration', {
  event_category: 'migration',
  event_label: 'old_to_new_domain',
  value: 1,
});
```

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing

- [ ] All pages load correctly on new domain
- [ ] Authentication/login works
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] File uploads/downloads function

### Redirect Testing

```bash
# Test key redirects
curl -I https://aegis-ai.com
curl -I https://aegis-ai.com/arena

# Should return 301 responses to llmworks.dev
```

### Performance Testing

- [ ] CDN configuration working
- [ ] SSL certificate valid

## Rollback Plan
