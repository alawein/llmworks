# Security Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified and the
comprehensive fixes implemented to address them.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Auth OTP Long Expiry ⚠️ **FIXED**

**Issue**: OTP expiry exceeded recommended threshold **Risk Level**: Warning
**Impact**: Extended OTP validity window increases risk of unauthorized access

**Fix Implemented**:

- Updated `supabase/config.toml` to reduce OTP expiry from default (24 hours) to
  **5 minutes (300 seconds)**
- Applied to both email and SMS OTP
- Added additional auth security configurations:
  - JWT expiry: 1 hour
  - Refresh token rotation enabled
  - Minimum password length: 8 characters
  - Password requirements: letters and digits
  - Double confirmation for email changes
  - SSL enforcement for database connections

**Files Modified**:

- `supabase/config.toml`

### 2. API Keys Could Be Stolen by Hackers ⚠️ **FIXED**

**Issue**: Encrypted API keys in 'models' table could be accessed if RLS
policies fail **Risk Level**: Warning **Impact**: Sensitive API keys could be
exposed to unauthorized users

**Fix Implemented**:

- **Enhanced Encryption**: Created secure API key management system
  (`src/lib/secure-api-keys.ts`)
- **Additional Security Layers**:
  - API key format validation per provider
  - SHA256 hashing for integrity verification
  - Access level controls (user/admin/restricted)
  - Key rotation capabilities
  - Usage tracking (last_used timestamps)
  - Comprehensive audit logging
- **Database Enhancements**:
  - Added security metadata columns to models table
  - Enhanced RLS policies with additional access controls
  - Separation of basic model info vs. encrypted key access
  - Admin-only key management functions

**New Security Features**:

- `encryptApiKey()` - AES-256 encryption with unique salt
- `validateApiKeyFormat()` - Provider-specific validation
- `rotateApiKey()` - Secure key rotation
- `revokeApiKey()` - Secure key revocation
- Security audit trail for all key operations

**Files Created/Modified**:

- `src/lib/secure-api-keys.ts` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20250812_security_fixes.sql` (new)

### 3. User Behavior Data Could Be Exposed to Competitors ⚠️ **FIXED**

**Issue**: Analytics events with user_id = NULL accessible to all users,
exposing business intelligence **Risk Level**: Warning **Impact**: Anonymous
user behavior patterns could be viewed by competitors

**Fix Implemented**:

- **Restrictive Access Control**: Complete overhaul of analytics access
  (`src/lib/secure-analytics.ts`)
- **Admin-Only Access**: Analytics data now restricted to admin users only
- **User Privacy Protection**:
  - Users can only view their own analytics events
  - Anonymous events hidden from regular users
  - Payload sanitization to remove sensitive data
- **Secure Analytics View**: Created `analytics_summary` view with aggregated,
  non-sensitive data
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All analytics access logged for security
  monitoring

**New Security Features**:

- `checkAdminAccess()` - Role-based access verification
- `getUserAnalytics()` - User's own data only
- `getAdminAnalytics()` - Full access for admins with logging
- `sanitizePayload()` - Remove sensitive information from events
- `exportAnalyticsData()` - Secure data export with access controls

**Files Created/Modified**:

- `src/lib/secure-analytics.ts` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20250812_security_fixes.sql` (updated)

## Additional Security Enhancements

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implemented admin role verification system
- Role assignment validation (only admins can assign admin role)
- Role assignment audit trail

### Security Audit System

- Comprehensive security event logging
- `security_audit_log` table for all sensitive operations
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Detailed event context and metadata

### Encryption Key Management

- Environment-based encryption keys
- Key rotation infrastructure
- Multiple encryption methods support

### Database Security

- Enhanced RLS policies with granular controls
- Secure database functions with `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Proper search_path protection
- Performance indexes for security queries

## Implementation Files

### Database Migrations

- `supabase/migrations/20250812_security_fixes.sql` - Complete security overhaul

### Security Libraries

- `src/lib/secure-api-keys.ts` - API key management with encryption
- `src/lib/secure-analytics.ts` - Secure analytics access control

### Configuration

- `supabase/config.toml` - Auth security settings

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers for each component
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access what they need
3. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of security events
4. **Fail Secure**: Default to deny access when in doubt
5. **Data Sanitization**: Remove sensitive data from logs and analytics
6. **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted with AES-256
7. **Role-Based Access**: Admin/user separation with proper validation

## Verification Steps

To verify the security fixes are working:

1. **OTP Expiry**: Test OTP expires after 5 minutes
2. **API Key Security**: Verify only key owners can access encrypted keys
3. **Analytics Access**: Confirm non-admin users cannot see analytics data
4. **Admin Functions**: Test admin-only functions require proper authorization
5. **Audit Logging**: Check security events are properly logged

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Set unique `VITE_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SALT` in
   production
2. **Database Migration**: Apply migration in maintenance window
3. **Config Update**: Deploy Supabase config changes
4. **User Communication**: Inform users of shorter OTP validity
5. **Admin Setup**: Ensure at least one admin user exists before deployment

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Review security audit logs regularly
- Monitor API key usage patterns
- Rotate encryption keys periodically
- Update security configurations based on new threats
- Regular security assessments
